# Coffee Machine Simulation

## Overview

**Project Title**: Coffee Machine Simulation  

**Project Description**:  
This project simulates a coffee vending machine that offers users a selection of drinks, processes payments, manages resources, and provides real-time reports on the machine's status. The program is built using Python and follows object-oriented programming principles to ensure modularity and scalability.  

**Project Goals**:  
- Simulate a coffee machine with real-world functionalities.  
- Allow users to interact with the system through a user-friendly interface.  
- Provide real-time reporting of resources and profits.  
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs or insufficient resources.  
- Extend the program with additional features, such as dynamic menu updates and transaction analytics.  

## Instructions for Build and Use  

### Steps to Build and/or Run the Software:  

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.  
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system (recommended version: 3.8 or higher).  
3. Install any required libraries (if applicable).  
4. Run the `main.py` file in a terminal or IDE.  

### Instructions for Using the Software:  

1. Launch the program by running `main.py`.  
2. Choose a drink from the displayed menu or type `report` to see the current resource and profit status.  
3. Insert the required coins to purchase a drink. The machine will provide change if needed.  
4. If resources are insufficient, the machine will notify you and return to the menu.  
5. Type `off` to shut down the program.  

## Development Environment  

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and libraries:  

* Python (version 3.8 or higher)  
* Optional: A code editor or IDE like VS Code or PyCharm  

## Useful Websites to Learn More  

I found these websites useful in developing this software:  

* [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)  
* [Real Python Tutorials](https://realpython.com/)  
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)  

## Future Work  

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:  

* [ ] Add a feature to save and load transaction data.  
* [ ] Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.  
* [ ] Enhance resource management with alerts for low resource levels.  
* [ ] Include customization options for drinks (e.g., sugar levels, extra shots).  
* [ ] Refactor the code to include unit testing for key functionalities.
